## Create A Factoid Address

The first thing you need is most probably a Factoid Address (FA), and it's very easy to do that with our new wallet.
If you haven't already done so, [Run Wallet](#run-enterprise-wallet).

Click on Address Book.

Then hover with your mouse on the "yellow +" button at the bottom right.

The button will expand and show "NEW ADDRESS," then click on it.

All you need is type a Nickname for the address, also known as "alias," then click "ADD TO ADDRESS BOOK."
We nicknamed our address FCT01, give it a name that is relevant to you.

The wallet will prompt you with the newly created FA address and its nickname.

If you want to, click on "Open address in new tab" to see more details including its QR code.

If needed, you can quickly copy the address to your smartphone with any QR code reader app, otherwise, click "COPY TO CLIPBOARD" to use on your computer instead. Once done, click on "MANAGE ADDRESSES" or the X button at the top right to return to your Address Book.

You will see your newly created address in the list.

<aside class="warning"><br>
Note that some addresses have a "full white star" on their left, others have an "empty star".
This is to show you the addresses that have been created with your wallet "seed" (full white star) and the ones that have been imported (empty star) also known as "External Addresses."
As we mentioned in the "Backup Your Wallets!" guide only addresses created with the wallet seed can be recovered with the "seed file."

If you click on the blue QR code button on the left of an address, you will go back to the QR code screen above.

If you click on the blue pencil, you will be able to edit address details such as its Nickname, and more.

![Wallet 12](images/wallet_031.png)

In the "EDIT FACTOID ADDRESS" screen you can simply change its Nickname by typing over the old one.
You can change the Nickname as many times as you want.

Another thing you notice is the "DISPLAY PRIVATE KEY" button, if you click it, it will show "Displaying private key is disabled in settings."

Let's give it a try so you can get familiar with another important function. Go to "Settings," select "Enable ability to export private keys" then hit "SAVE CHANGES."

You can view the seed phrases that generate your internal addresses by clicking the Backup button on the sidebar.
</aside>

Then go back to your Address Book and click on the "blue pencil" to edit your address. 
If you now click on "DISPLAY PRIVATE KEY" it will appear on the left.

<aside class="warning"><br> 
We strongly recommend saving the Private Keys of all your External Addresses by clicking the "COPY TO CLIPBOARD" button and pasting to a file or simply by writing them down.
This is to be able to import your External Addresses in case you [restore your original seed](#restore-a-seed) when, for example, you switch to a new computer or your hard drive fails.
The seed will not be able to re-generate External Addresses.
Alternatively, save your wallet file as mentioned in the Backup Your Wallets! guide.
As uncle Bob used to say, better be safe than sorry!

You have learned how to generate a new FCT address and quite a few more things in between. (thumbs up)
