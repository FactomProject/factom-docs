It will show you, for example, when the Factom Network is under maintenance.

**Factom Live Stats**

Another useful tool is the following found at:

It will show you some live stats for factom such as:

* Number of Records
* Number of Entries
* Number of Anchors

It will present the data in the below format:
 
`{"Records":85775274,"Entries":5981665,"Anchors":68227}` 

**Factoid Live**

Finally a third party site, Factoid Live, built by a community member and found at:

It can show you the top FCT and EC addresses and their balances. Factom is not responsible for the accuracy of the data presented.
