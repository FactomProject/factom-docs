## Redeem FCT from Koinify

This section is relevant if you participated in our Software Token Sale hosted by Koinify back in 2015 and haven't redeemed your Factoids (FCT). Although Koinify closed their operations, they never held your FCT, and you only need your 12-word master passphrase to access your FCT.

The 12-word master passphrase can be used with the Factom Foundation Wallet to create the crypto signatures required to reassign the Factoids to another address or purchase Entry Credits. So go find that magical piece of paper where you wrote down your unique 12-word magic spell and follow the instructions below:

To get hold of your FCT, run the wallet if you haven't already.

Go to the address book and select "NEW ADDRESS".

From the drop down menu select "Import from Koinify phrase".

In this example we use the word "yellow" 12 times, yours will be different and unique to yourself. Type it or paste it in the address bar. After adding a Nickname (ours is FCT05) and selecting "ADD TO ADDRESS BOOK" the FCT balance should be assigned to a new FA address and appear in the list of addresses. The balance should also show in the total wallet balance at the top.

<aside class="warning"><br>
The 12-word master passphrase was shown once at the time of purchase to contributors who were prompted to keep it in a safe place.
<br>
Without the Master Passphrase, it is impossible to redeem Factoids, and neither Factom nor Koinify can recover it. We really meant what we said.
<br>
Do not share your passphrase with anybody or they will be able to access your FCT.
<br>
There is no expiry date for the 12-word master passphrase. You will be able to redeem your FCT at your leisure, anytime in the future.

You are a champ! You are ready to use your FCT to trade or buy EC.
