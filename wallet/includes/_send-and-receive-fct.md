## Send and Receive FCT

**You can send Factoids** (FCT) from your local wallet to a another local Factoid Address (FA) within your wallet, to an exchange or thrid party. To do so you will need a source address and a destination address.
You need to perform this action when you want to send FCT to an exchange, a friend, or a third party.  
Assuming you have a local FA address containing some FCT you wish to send and have a destination address you will need to: [Run Wallet](#run-enterprise-wallet). (Yes, we know it's growing on you)

**You can receive Factoids** using the same instructions below, for instance, if you want to move FCT between two FA addresses within your local wallet. If instead you want to receive FCT from an exchange or a third party, you simply provide your FA Address to the sender. Once sent you can verify the transaction has confirmed as well as your local FCT balance. Our wallet makes it easy to grab the info you need for your FA addresses.

* One or more FA address to send from
* One or more recipient addresses
* The address that pays the fees
* Make sure you have enough FCT balance

<aside class="success"><br>
Have a play around with the various options and combinations, use "EDIT TRANSACTION" to modify or the "X" at the top right to go back to the transactions list.
</aside>

<aside class="warning"><br>
Double check all details before using "SEND TRANSACTION", if in doubt you can always try later when sure, transactions in Factom are irreversible.
</aside>

For this example we have selected 1 source address sending 0.1 FCT to recipient and where fees are paid by source. We also clicked "GET NEEDED INPUT" to see how much the transaction would cost in total, including the fee. Once happy select "VIEW TRANSACTION" to reveal the fee.

You are then ready to send or edit/cancel.

**Signing, Exporting, Importing Transactions**

There are times when recurring transactions with multiple inputs and outputs can be time consuming. So instead of having to set all details one by one each time, our wallet allows you to export them to a file reasy to use them at a later date and repeatedly.

<aside class="warning"><br>
Remember that signed transactions are at risk of being used by malitious actors in case they are found as they can be spent outside your wallet. Backing up unsigned transactions is the safest options as they require to be signed within your wallet to be executed. Make sure to store all your signed transactions in a safe place.

To check this handy function select "NEW TRANSACTION".
