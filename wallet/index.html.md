# Welcome

![Factom Federation](/images/wallet_084.png)
  
**Welcome to the Federation!**

The Factom Federation introduces a new network of federated servers that really bring it to the distributed game. After all, Honesty is subversive. So here is what you need to know, at a high-level Factom Federation adds several new features:

* Distributed servers
* A peer to peer network
* Higher throughput
* Confirmations in milliseconds
* More user feedback with the "Factom Control Panel"
* A more intuitive, redesigned Factom Foundation Wallet with added functionality
* Factom Explorer v2
* Factom RPC API v2
* Factom Wallet Lib RCP API v2
* A lot of fine tuning and stability improvements

These new Factom guides replace all our previous ones. We have covered how to:

* Get started using Factom Federation (FF) software
* Send and receive Factoids (FCT)
* Convert FCT to Entry Credits (EC)
* Make entries into Factom
* Use the Factom Explorer v2
* Use the Factom RPC API v2
* Use the Factom Wallet Lib RPC API v2
* And a lot more

Some of these guides are intended for users who know their way around the command line (you should know enough to be dangerous and get yourself out of trouble).

However, don't despair, we made sure to provide some easy to follow tutorials on how to use Factom with a Graphic User Interface (GUI) even though they still require some basic command line experience.
