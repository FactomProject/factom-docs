## Run Factom Federation

*Time to remember Mr. Miyagi's lesson.*
 
This step will be used every time you need to run Factom Federation software, so get familiar with it. Practice makes perfect. Wax on, wax off.
 
Every time you come across "**Run FF**" you need to perform the following steps. These are the necessary steps to run the wallet.

<aside class="warning"><br>
For Mac and Windows, use the cd command with Terminal to browse to the location of your FF installation. On Linux, you will be able to run commands without having to browse the to install location.
</aside>

This step is required before you run factomd, factom-walletd, and factom-cli. The three applications are required to run the Factom Federation software.

In a new Terminal window, run

**Mac**

`cd /Applications/Factom/`

**Windows**

`cd C:\Program Files (x86)\Factom\`

On Mac, Windows and Linux, run "factomd" first

`factomd`

Then browse to [http://localhost:8090](http://localhost:8090) to see the Control Panel for your local FF node.

<aside class="notice"><br>
If this is the first time you are running FF, and haven't downloaded the blockchain via HTTP as recommended above, now's a very good time to check your Facebook feed or take your dog for a walk. 
The blockchain is... big. Syncing the Factom blockchain may take a little while. The Factom Control panel will display the progress and notify you when it has finished syncing. This will also occur when it has been a while since the last time you have run factomd. However, after the first full sync is complete, successive syncs are faster and you will only have to sync blocks since the last full sync.
<br>
You can alternatively download the first 70,000 blocks via disk image by following our <a href="#starting-factom-via-bootstrap">Bootstrap Guide</a>.
</aside>

Once you are synced, in a new Terminal window browse (cd) to the location of your FF installation as you did above (Mac and Windows only).

<aside class="warning"><br>
There are two options now, one for people who have run Factom Genesis (FG), our previous software release, and one for people who haven't. The former has to import their old FG wallet file; the latter doesn't. Choose the next step accordingly.
</aside>

### If you have used FG

If you have run our previous software release “Factom Genesis (FG)” you need to import your FG wallet file (named *factoid_wallet_bolt.db*) the first time your run *factom-walletd* to make sure all its previous addresses and balances are transferred over. You have learned how to backup your wallet file in our [Backup Your Wallet File!](#backup-your-wallet-file) guide and you should know if still in the default location within the .factom folder at ~/.factom/factoid_wallet_bolt.db.

Simply run the next command with a special flag and the path to your wallet file: 

factom-walletd -i=PATH_TO_YOUR_FGWALLETFILE.

For example, if your FG wallet file is still in the .factom folder, run:

`factom-walletd -i=~/.factom/factoid_wallet_bolt.db`  
 
This command will tell factom-walletd to look for the file at the specified path and import all its addresses into the new wallet. The file can be located in a different location on your hard drive, just make sure to specify the path properly.

If by any chance the operation fails, quit factom-walletd, delete the new wallet file located at ~/.factom/wallet/factoid_wallet.db and try again until you get all your addresses back.

<aside class="success"><br>
Remember, you only need to do this once the first time you run factom-walletd, after that you can run it normally. 
</aside>

Once you are happy, continue by following the instructions to run the factom-cli command below. 

### If you have never used FG 

Run:

`factom-walletd`

You are now ready to use factom-cli to run commands in your third Terminal window. 
Run the command -h (help) to see all the available commands and their descriptions.
cd to the location of your FF installation first, then run:

`factom-cli -h`
