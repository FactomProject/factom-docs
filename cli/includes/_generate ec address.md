## Generate an Entry Credit Address

Perform this step only if you intend to make entries into Factom or want to stock up on Entry Credits (EC) for future use.
Remember, ECs are non-transferrable and cannot be sold or traded on an exchange. Make sure you need them before you go ahead.

To proceed, [Run FF](#run-factom-federation).

You are now ready to use factom-cli to generate a new Entry Credit (EC) address.

Run:

`factom-cli newecaddress`

> Terminal output for:<br>
> `factom-cli newecaddress`


```shell
> factom-cli newecaddress
EC27kDNpFcJQwvdpFXaXjPqhtDSf6VK8kRN8Fv7EkhvS9tVkuAfX
```

Sample Terminal output is shown on the right.

The new EC address will be unique to your wallet and different from the above.

Congratulations on your first EC address. You are seriously killing it.
