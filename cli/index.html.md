# Introduction

![Factom Federation](/images/wallet_084.png)

**Welcome to the Federation!**

This is the Factom CLI documentation. The following guides will allow you to install, run and/or compile and build the command line apps and tools necessary to run Factom Federation software.

These new Factom guides replace all our previous ones. The Factom CLI guides are intended for users who know their way around the command line (you should know enough to be dangerous and get yourself out of trouble).
